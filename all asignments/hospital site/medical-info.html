<p>When an emergency happens, whether it's a heart attack or a hurricane, it's critical that medical service providers have access to health information for anyone who needs assistance.

While you can't predict when an emergency may happen, you can be prepared. Make sure that key health information is up to date, accurate and handy.

Nowadays, you may find it useful to store this information in an online patient health record and share it with your doctor and emergency contact person. In fact, you may already have access to a patient portal, which is an electronic health information tool offered by many insurance companies, employers and health care institutions.

If you have children, it is important to handle their emergency health information similarly. You may not be available to provide needed information in an emergency.

Include in your health record, whether digital or paper, the following information:

Your name, age and sex
Your address
Your medication names, doses and schedules
Your medical equipment
Your chronic medical conditions, such as epilepsy
Medical consent form
Aspects of your health history that could be helpful to emergency medical responders, including allergies and immunization record
Phone numbers for professional emergency contacts, such as your family doctor, local emergency services, emergency road service providers, and the regional poison control center
Phone numbers for a personal emergency contact, such as a friend or a family member who you've asked to serve in this role</p>
